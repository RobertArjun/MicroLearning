# What is a Microservice? 
Microservices are a software development techniqueâ€”a variant of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services.
In a microservices architecture, services are fine-grained.
The benefit of decomposing an application into different smaller services is that it improves modularity. This makes the application easier to understand, develop, test, and become more resilient to architecture erosion.111 
It parallelizes development by enabling small autonomous teams to develop, deploy and scale their respective services independently.t21
